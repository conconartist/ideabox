Project spec & rubric can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/ideabox-group.html)

## Overview and Learning Goals:

Create functionality for a website that allows a user to save ideas with a title and body that can be saved to the browser's Local Storage. The user is able to favorite/star ideas as well as delete ideas they no longer need. Through the process of four progressive iterations, the developer will have written clean, DRY JavaScript to store the data model class and access the DOM. The developer is expected to manipulate the page by adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM, as well as understand the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.


## Technologies Used:

* JavaScript

* CSS

* HTML

## How to Run and View, Instructions for the User:

* Go to the deployed page [here](https://conconartist.github.io/ideabox/)
* Enter a Title and Body for your idea to enable the Save button
* Click the Save button to see your idea displayed on a card in the space below the form

* Click on the Star logo on the idea card to add that idea to your favorites
* If you would like to delete an idea card, click on the 'X' logo on the card
* To display only your starred (favorite) ideas, click on the Show Starred Ideas button in the menu bar on the left side of the website. To toggle back to displaying all of your ideas, click the Show All Ideas button

* You can filter the displayed cards by entering text into the Search ideas field. Only the cards that match your search will be displayed.
* Upon refreshing the website, the page should remain the same. The saved cards and display state will be unchanged.
